## Development Plan
Below is the step-by-step plan for completing the Personal Portfolio Website:

### **1. Project Setup**
- Initialize the project using the selected framework (e.g., React with Vite).
- Set up folder structure:
  - `src/` for components, assets, and styles.
  - `public/` for static files.
- Create a basic homepage to confirm the setup is working.

### **2. Design Planning**
- Sketch the portfolio layout (tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or a simple wireframe).
- Identify required sections:
  - **About Me**
  - **Skills**
  - **Projects**
  - **Contact**
- Choose a color scheme and typography to align with personal branding.

### **3. Core Structure**
- Build reusable components:
  - Navbar, Footer, Cards, and Buttons.
- Create the following pages/components:
  - **Home**: Introduction and quick links to other sections.
  - **About**: Detailed bio, background, and goals.
  - **Skills**: Visual representation of technologies (e.g., skill bars or icons).
  - **Projects**: Display portfolio projects dynamically using JSON or API.
  - **Contact**: Form for email submission.

### **4. Implement Routing**
- Set up React Router for navigation between sections/pages.
- Ensure smooth transitions between routes.

### **5. Populate Content**
- Add placeholder data for each section.
- Replace placeholder data with real information:
  - Projects: Add descriptions, screenshots, and GitHub links.
  - Skills: List tools, frameworks, and proficiencies.

### **6. Add Interactivity and Animations**
- Use libraries like **Framer Motion** or **React Spring** for animations.
- Implement a **dark mode toggle**.
- Add hover effects and transitions for buttons and cards.

### **7. Optimize for Mobile and Accessibility**
- Use responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across devices.
- Test accessibility with tools like Lighthouse or axe.

### **8. Deploy the Website**
- Choose a hosting platform:
  - **Vercel** or **Netlify** for ease of deployment.
  - GitHub Pages as a free alternative.
- Test the live site to ensure all links, styles, and components work as expected.

### **9. Future Enhancements**
- Add a blog section to share knowledge and experiences.
- Integrate analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) to track site visitors.
- Include additional sections for certifications, testimonials, or a resume download.
